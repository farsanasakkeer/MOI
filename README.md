# MOI UAE App Prototype 

Our project aims to create a more user-friendly version of the MOI app in the UAE, specifically designed for senior citizens and people of determination. We recognized that these groups may face challenges navigating traditional app interfaces, so we focused on making the app more accessible and intuitive.

# Solution
To address the usability concerns, we redesigned the app interface to be more gamified, allowing users to easily access services directly from the home page without confusion. We implemented features such as highlighting and enlarging text when hovering over tabs, using a color theme suitable for individuals with eyesight problems, and incorporating voice commands to assist users in navigating the app.

# TECHNICAL CHOICES
# User Interface
Gamified Interface: We chose to gamify the interface to engage users and make it more intuitive.
Hover Effects: Implemented hover effects to highlight tabs and make them more visible.
Color Theme: Selected a color theme suitable for senior citizens with eyesight issues.
Voice Commands: Integrated voice commands to aid navigation, especially for users with limited mobility.
Development Tools
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Used standard web development technologies for cross-platform compatibility.
SVG Graphics: Leveraged SVG for scalable and interactive graphics, enhancing the user experience.
Accessibility: Ensured accessibility features were implemented to cater to diverse user needs.
Trade-offs and Future Developments
While we aimed to create a more user-friendly app prototype, there were some trade-offs and areas for future development:

Quiz Integration: We intended to include quizzes on the home page to provide interactive learning opportunities. This could enhance user engagement and provide educational value.
Voice Commands Expansion: Although we implemented voice commands for basic navigation, expanding this feature to cover all app services could further improve accessibility and user experience.
Service Enhancements: Each service within the app could be improved further by refining the interface, adding more intuitive features, and incorporating user feedback.
Performance Optimization: As the project evolves, optimizing performance to ensure smooth operation across different devices and network conditions would be essential.
